This dataset was created using data from [Earth System Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/).
This data contains Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Dry Air Mole Fractions from quasi-continuous daily measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.


### Preparation

To generate output file you should only run the script:
`co2-ppm-daily-flow.py`

### Data

Data has been sourced from Scripps Laboratory, specifically: https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/assets/data/atmospheric/stations/in_situ_co2/daily/daily_in_situ_co2_mlo.csv.

Output file is located in: `data/co2-ppm-daily.csv`

Value represents Mole fraction reported in units of micromol mol-1 (10-6 mol per mol of dry air); equivalent to ppm (parts per million).
