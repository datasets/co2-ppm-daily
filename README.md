This dataset was created using data from [Earth System Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/).
This data contains Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Dry Air Mole Fractions from quasi-continuous daily measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.


### Preparation

To generate output file you should only run the script:
`co2-ppm-daily-flow.py`

### Data

Data has been scraped from two different sources:
* First source contains values from 01.01.1958 to 31.12.2004
* Second source contains values from 01.01.1973 to 31.12.2017.
* Third source contains values until today.

Since there is a lot of overlapping between the sources, output file is created in a way that all existing values are included.

Output file is located in: `data/co2-ppm-daily.csv`

Value represents Mole fraction reported in units of micromol mol-1 (10-6 mol per mol of dry air); equivalent to ppm (parts per million).
